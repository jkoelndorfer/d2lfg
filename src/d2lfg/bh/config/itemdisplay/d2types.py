``d2lfg.bh.config.itemdisplay.d2types``
=======================================

This module contains compositions of types defined in :py:mod:`~d2lfg.d2core.d2types`
with BH ItemDisplay filter expressions and output codes.

These composed types allow for users to interact with a single object that
represents an in-game concept, access its properties, and also use that object
to define BH filter expressions and outputs.

Game databases should return types defined in this file.
